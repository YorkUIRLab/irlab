Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|2008. Angel of peace in Donetsk]]\\n\\n'''Peace''' occurs between heterogeneous social groups and is characterized by a lack of [[wikt:conflict#Noun|conflict]] and [[freedom]] from [[fear]] of [[violence]]. Commonly understood as the absence of [[hostility]], peace often involves compromise, and therefore is initiated with thoughtful listening and communication to enhance and create mutual understanding.\\n\\nPeace can be defined in a positive direction and in a negative sense. Positively, peace is a state of tranquility and stillness; however, in a negative sense, peace is the [[wikt:absence|absence]] of [[war]] or violence.\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe term 'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French ''pes,'' and the Old French ''pais'', meaning \\\"peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement\\\" (11th century).<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peace&allowed_in_frame=0 \\\"Peace\\\"].</ref> But, ''Pes'' itself comes from the Latin ''pax'', meaning \\\"peace, compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony.\\\" The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word [[shalom]], which, according to Jewish theology, comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete, whole'. <ref>Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research centre: http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_peace.html</ref> Although 'peace' is the usual translation, however, it is an incomplete one, because 'shalom,' which is also cognate with the Arabic ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'', has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} At a personal level, peaceful behaviors are kind, considerate, [[respect]]ful, just, and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest [[good faith|goodwill]].\\n\\nThis latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being \\\"at peace\\\" in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of \\\"[[Silence|quiet]]\\\", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] — an absence of disturbance or agitation.\\n\\nIn many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[aloha]], as well as the Arabic word ''salaam''. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase ''[[rest in peace]]''.\\n\\n[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] in his research project which led to the book ''The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies'' (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his ''Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture'' (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families.\\n\\n==Religious beliefs and peace {{anchor|Religion}}==\\n[[File:Eiréné et Ploutos.JPG|thumb|upright=1|Statue of [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], goddess of peace in ancient Greek religion, with her son Pluto.]]\\nReligious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies. Among [[polytheism|pagan faiths]], worship of [[personification|personified]] Peace was organized in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] under the name [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]] (\\\"Peace\\\") in [[ancient Greek religion|Greek-speaking areas]] and as [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]] (\\\"Peace\\\") in [[ancient Roman religion|Latin-speaking ones]]. Her [[idolatry|idols]] depicted a full-grown woman, usually with a [[cornucopia|horn of plenty]] and [[scepter]] and sometimes with a [[torch]] or [[olive branch|olive leaves]].\\n\\n[[Christians]], who believe [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] to be the [[Jewish Messiah]] called [[Christ (title)|Christ]] (meaning Anointed One),<ref>Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research Center:http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_messiah.html></ref> interpret Isaiah 9:6 as a [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecy]] of Jesus in which he is called the \\\"[[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|Prince of Peace]].\\\"<ref>“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, 'Prince of Peace'.” [New International Version]</ref> In the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]: And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.\\n\\nNumerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy [[Rosary]] as a means to foster peace. Subsequently to the Encyclical Mense maio,1965, in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary, \\\"the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs,\\\" and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri, 1966, to implore peace, Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis, october 1969, that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace.\\n\\n[[Islam]] derived from the root word salam which literally means peace. Muslims are called followers of Islam. [[Quran]] clearly stated \\\"Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah, hearts are assured\\\" and stated \\\"O you who have believed, when you are told, \\\"Space yourselves\\\" in assemblies, then make space; Allah will make space for you. And when you are told, \\\"Arise,\\\" then arise; Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.\\\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/13/28|title=peaceful quran}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/58/11|title=peaceful quran}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Buddhist]]s believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends. They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the [[Buddha]] adhere to a set of teachings called the [[Four Noble Truths]] — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.\\n\\n[[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts contain the following passages:\\n{{quote|May there be peace in the heavens, peace in the atmosphere, peace on the earth. Let there be coolness in the water, healing in the herbs and peace radiating from the trees. Let there be harmony in the planets and in the stars, and perfection in eternal knowledge. May everything in the universe be at peace. Let peace pervade everywhere, at all times. May I experience that peace within my own heart.|[[Yajur Veda]] 36.17)}}\\n\\n{{quote|Let us not concord with our own people, and concord with people who are strangers to us. Celestial Twins, create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts. May we unite in our minds, unite in our purposes, and not fight against the heavenly spirit within us. Let not the battle-cry rise amidst many slain, nor the arrows of the war-god fall with the break of day|Yajur Veda 7.52}}\\n\\n{{quote|A superior being does not render evil for evil. This is a maxim one should observe... One should never harm the wicked or the good or even animals meriting death. A noble soul will exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or cruel deeds... Who is without fault?|[[Valmiki]]|[[Ramayana]]}}\\n\\n{{quote|The chariot that leads to victory is of another kind. Valour and fortitude are its wheels; truthfulness and tirtuous conduct are its banner; strength, discretion, self-restraint and benevolence are its four horses, harnessed with the cords of forgiveness, compassion and equanimity... Whoever has this righteous chariot, has no enemy to conquer anywhere.|Valmiki|Ramayana}}\\n\\n===Inner peace===\\n{{main article|Inner peace}}\\n[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|200px|Buddhist monk during meditation near Phu Soidao Nationalpark.]]\\nInner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress. Being \\\"at peace\\\" is considered by many to be healthy [[homeostasis]] and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.\\n\\nPeace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer, meditation, t'ai chi ch'uan ([[T'ai chi ch'uan|太极拳, tàijíquán]]) or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as the [[New Age]] movement. Inner peace is also the first of four concepts to living life in the [[rave]] culture acronym [[PLUR]].\\n\\n=== Satyagraha ===\\n{{Main article|Satyagraha}}\\nSatyagraha ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}} {{IAST|''satyāgraha''}}) is a philosophy and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].\\n\\nThe word ''satyagraha'' itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.\\n\\n[[File:Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at a civil rights march on Washington D.C. in 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interrracial Justice, at a civil rights march on Washington, D.C.]]\\nSatyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: \\\"They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...\\\"<ref>R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm \\\"The Gospel Of Sarvodaya], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.</ref> A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to [[A. J. Muste]], sums it up: 'There is no way to peace; peace is the way.'\\n\\n==Justice and injustice==\\nSince classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).\\n\\nDiscussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (''just peace'').<ref>Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 129, ISBN 978-80-224-1341-1.</ref>\\nA peace must be seen at least in two forms: \\n* A simple silence of arms, absence of [[war]].\\n* Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.\\n\\nMore recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|title=The Theory of Active Peace|work=internationalpeaceandconflict.org}}</ref> which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.\\n\\n==Long periods of peace==\\n{{See also|List of periods of regional peace}}\\nThe longest continuing period of peace among currently existing states is observed in [[Sweden]], which has had peace since 1814 (for {{age|1814|1|15}} years), (if Swedish participation in the wars in Afghanistan and Libya is not considered) after its loss of major parts of the country to Russia in the [[Napoleon wars]]. Swedish peace may partly be explained by its geographical position, partly by non-participation in military alliances during peacetime, resulting in a certain level of [[Swedish neutrality]] during wartime, and partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as [[Pax Britannica]] (1815-1914) and [[Pax Europaea]]/[[Pax Americana]] (since 1950s).\\n\\nOther examples of long periods of peace are:\\n* the [[isolationism|isolationistic]] [[Edo period]] (also known as [[Tokugawa shogunate]]) in Japan 1603 to 1868 (250 years)\\n* [[Pax Khazarica]] in [[Khazar Khanate]] (south-east Turkey) about 700-950 AD (250 years)\\n* [[Pax Romana]] in the Roman empire (for 190 or 206 years).\\n\\n==Movements and activism==\\n\\n===Pacifism===\\n{{Main article|Pacifism}}\\n\\n[[File:Peace sign.svg|thumb|220px|A [[peace sign]], which is widely associated with pacifism]]\\nPacifism is the categorical opposition to any forms of [[war]] or [[violence]] as means of settling disputes or gaining advantage. Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved; to calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war; to opposition to any organization of society through governmental force ([[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchist]] or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] pacifism); to rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals; to opposition to violence under any circumstance, including defense of self and others.\\n\\nPacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that violence of any form is an inappropriate response to conflict, and is morally wrong.  Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists in general reject theories of [[Just War]].\\n\\n===Organizations===\\n\\n==== United Nations ====\\n{{Main article|United Nations}}\\nThe United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achieving [[world peace]]. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.\\n\\n{{See also|List of United Nations peacekeeping missions}}\\n[[File:United Nations peacekeeping missions 2009.svg|thumb|[[List of UN peacekeeping missions|UN peacekeeping missions]]. Dark blue regions indicate current missions, while light blue regions represent former missions.]]\\nThe UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the \\\"Blue Helmets\\\", who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.\\n\\n====League of Nations====\\nThe principal forerunner of the United Nations was the [[League of Nations]]. It was created at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and emerged from the advocacy of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and the League was based in [[Geneva]] until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the [[League of Nations Union]], gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan.\\n\\nOne of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]]. Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League, such as [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Florence Stawell]] - the so-called \\\"Greece and peace\\\" set - he came to this from the study of the [[classics]].\\n\\nThe creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the [[Union for Democratic Control]] during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] at [[Chatham House]] in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalize, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales, in 1919.\\n\\n====Olympic Games====\\nThe late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and ultimately the [[League of Nations]], also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal. Led by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern [[Olympic Games]].\\n\\n====Nobel Peace Prize====\\n{{Main article|Nobel Peace Prize}}\\n[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Dunant]] was awarded the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his role in founding the [[International Red Cross]].]]\\nThe highest honour awarded to peace maker is the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]], awarded since 1901 by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]].

An [[iterated game]] originally played in academic groups and by [[computer simulation]] for years to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].<ref>Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.</ref> As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. The only [[strategy]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was a \\\"[[Genghis Khan]]\\\", a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led to the development of the \\\"provokable nice guy\\\" [[strategy]], a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor.\\n\\n===Balance of power theories===\\n{{Main article|Balance of power (international relations)}}\\nThe classical \\\"realist\\\" position is that the key to promoting order between states, and so of increasing the chances of peace, is the maintenance of a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] between states - a situation where no state is so dominant that it can \\\"lay down the law to the rest\\\". Exponents of this view have included [[Metternich]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. A related approach - more in the tradition of [[Hugo Grotius]] than [[Thomas Hobbes]] - was articulated by the so-called \\\"[[English school of international relations theory]]\\\" such as [[Martin Wight]] in his book ''Power Politics'' (1946, 1978) and [[Hedley Bull]] in ''The Anarchical Society'' (1977).\\n\\nAs the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for [[hegemony]].\\n\\nIn the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the [[cold war]],  a particular form of balance of power - mutual nuclear deterrence - emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the \\\"nuclear umbrella\\\" made it \\\"safe\\\" for smaller wars (e.g. the [[Vietnam war]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring]]), so making such wars more likely.\\n\\n===Democratic peace theory===\\n{{Main article|Democratic peace theory}}\\nThe democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another.\\n\\n===Peace, free trade, interdependence, and globalization===\\nIt was a central tenet of [[classical liberalism]], for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) said that he was \\\"brought up\\\" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s.<ref>Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.</ref>  During the [[economic globalization]] in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as [[Norman Angell]] argued that the growth \\nof economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1914.\\n\\nThese ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century.<ref>For sources, see articles on [[liberalism]] and [[classical liberalism]].</ref> These ideas have seen [[capitalism]] as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.\\n\\n===Peace, socialism, capitalism, and managed capitalism===\\nSocialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., [[Lenin]], [[J.A. Hobson]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.\\n\\nHowever, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] at [[Breton Woods, New Jersey|Bretton Woods]] in 1944, and later of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (subsequently the [[World Trade Organization]]).<ref>. See [[Donald Markwell]]. ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\\n\\n===Theory of 'active peace'===\\nBorrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',<ref>Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.</ref> and on the writings of Maine Quaker [[Gray Cox]], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [[John Woolman College]] initiative have arrived at a theory of \\\"active peace\\\". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word ''shalom''.  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into ''active peace'', dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping, and/or peace building.<ref>{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url=http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 7 February 2010 }}</ref>\\n\\n===Peace, international organization, and international law===\\nOne of the most influential theories of peace, especially since [[Woodrow Wilson]] led the creation of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of [[international law]] promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the [[United Nations]], and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], for example in his 1936 book ''The League of Nations and the Rule of Law''.<ref>Macmillan, 1936.</ref>\\n\\n===Trans-national solidarity===\\nMany \\\"idealist\\\" thinkers about international relations - e.g. in the traditions of [[Kant]] and [[Karl Marx]] - have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.<ref>See, e.g., Sir [[Harry Hinsley]]. ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.</ref>\\n\\nOne version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], and his successors such as [[J. William Fulbright]].<ref>Discussed above. See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]]. ''\\\"Instincts to Lead\\\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'' (2013).</ref>\\n\\nAnother theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources. <ref>http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU</ref>\\n\\n===Many peaces===\\nFollowing [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Wolfgang Sützl<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang Sützl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT Münster, Vienna, 2006</ref> and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of ''many peaces''. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.\\n\\n===Trans-rational peaces===\\nIn 2008 [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] enlarged his earlier approach of the ''many peaces'' to the so-called ''five families'' of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012</ref> Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.<ref>[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies. A Cultural Approach; Palgrave MacMillan London, 2011</ref> The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation, the so-called elicitive approach.<ref>[[John Paul Lederach]]: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse University Press, 1996</ref>\\n\\n==Peace and conflict studies==\\n[[File:Peace-and-Prosperity-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|250px|Detail from ''Peace and Prosperity'' (1896), [[Elihu Vedder]], Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]\\n{{Main article|Peace and conflict studies}}\\n'''Peace and conflict studies''' is an [[academic field]] which identifies and analyses [[Violence|violent]] and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours, as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent [[social conflict]]s.  This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable [[human condition]].<ref>Dugan, 1989: 74</ref> One variation,\\n'''Peace studies''' ([[irenology]]), is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, [[de-escalation]], and solution of conflicts. This contrasts with [[war studies]] (polemology), directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts. Disciplines involved may include [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of other disciplines.\\n\\n==Measuring and ranking peace==\\n\\nAlthough peace is widely perceived as something intangible, various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it. [[Global Peace Index|The Global Peace Index]] produced by [[Institute for Economics and Peace|the Institute for Economics and Peace]] is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the presence/absence of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-gpi-findings|title=Vision of Humanity|work=visionofhumanity.org}}</ref> The last edition of the Index ranks 162 countries on their internal and external levels of peace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/25/world/global-peace-index-iceland-syria/|title=Study: Iceland is the most peaceful nation in the world - CNN.com|author=Jethro Mullen, CNN|date=25 June 2015|work=CNN}}</ref> According to the 2015 Global Peace Index, Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-gpi-findings|title=Vision of Humanity|work=visionofhumanity.org}}</ref> [[Fragile States Index]](formerly known as the Failed States Index) created by the [[Fund for Peace]] focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreignpolicy.com/fragile-states-2014/|title=Fragile States 2014 - Foreign Policy|work=foreignpolicy.com}}</ref> The 2015 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan, and the least fragile one is Finland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-fragile-states-index-hunger-idps/2827703.html|title=South Sudan Tops List of World's Fragile States - Again|work=VOA}}</ref> [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the Institute for Economics and Peace, Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations like the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\\n* [[Catholic peace traditions]]\\n* [[Creative Peacebuilding]]\\n* [[Global Peace Index]]\\n* [[Group on International Perspectives on Governmental Aggression and Peace]] (GIPGAP)\\n* [[Human overpopulation#Warfare and conflict]]\\n* [[International Day of Peace]]\\n* [[List of peace activists]]\\n* [[List of places named after peace|List of places named Peace]]\\n* [[List of peace prizes|Peace prizes]]\\n* [[Moral syncretism]]\\n* [[Peace education]]\\n* [[Peace in Islamic philosophy]]\\n* [[Peace Journalism]]\\n* [[Peace makers]]\\n* [[Peace One Day]]\\n* [[Peace symbol]]\\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\\n* [[Peacemaking]]\\n* [[Structural violence]]\\n* [[Sulh]]\\n* [[Suresh Joachim|World Cease fire day]]\\n* [[War resister]]\\n* [[World peace]]\\n* [http://www.hwpl.kr/content.php?p=EN/warp World Alliance of Religions Peace Summit (WARP Summit)]\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Refbegin|2}}\\n* Sir [[Norman Angell]].
